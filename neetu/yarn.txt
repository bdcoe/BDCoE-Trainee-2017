                                               YARN

YARN is a resource manager that was created by separating the processing engine and resource management capabilities of MapReduce as it was implemented in Hadoop 1. YARN is often called the operating system of Hadoop because it is responsible for managing and monitoring workloads, maintaining a multi-tenant environment, implementing security controls, and managing high availability features of Hadoop. 

Like an operating system on a server, YARN is designed to allow multiple, diverse user applications to run on a multi-tenant platform. In Hadoop 1, users had the option of writing MapReduce programs in Java, in Python, Ruby or other scripting languages using streaming, or using Pig, a data transformation language. Regardless of which method was used, all fundamentally relied on the MapReduce processing model to run.

YARN supports multiple processing models in addition to MapReduce. One of the most significant benefits of this is that we are no longer limited to working the often I/O intensive, high latency MapReduce framework. This advance means Hadoop users should be familiar with the pros and cons of the new processing models and understand when to apply them to particular use cases.
