R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting.
There are many types of R-objects. The frequently used ones are -

Vectors
Lists
Matrices
Arrays
Factors
Data Frames


The function mean() is used to calculate this in R

The middle most value in a data series= median.Median() fn is used in R to cal this value.
The mode is the value that has highest no. of occurrences in a set of data. Unike mean and median, mode can have both numeric and character data.

R doesn't hv in-built fn to calculate mode. u can create one.
(using max fn)

sum fn for sum.

max fn for getting maximum value.

min fn for getting min value.

colSum to check where is missing value

str-nature and type of data

dim shows rows and column 

str info of data set

ggplot for plotting graphs

table(is.na()) for missing values
categorical variables=discete value 
continuous variables=values in a rythm

1 step : load data 
2 step : decide predictor and  response variable variable
3 step : analyse data and find missing values
4 step : fill the missing calues and do more data cleaning
